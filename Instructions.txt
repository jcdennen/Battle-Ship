Welcome to Battleship! You will have a 5x5 game board with 
25 locations to fire up to 15 missiles at. There will be two ships 
somewhere on the board (each ship 2 buttons in length) going 
either vertically or horizontally. You may see your hits and misses 
by selecting the corresponding check boxes. Hits will appear as 
red text. Misses will appear as white. The goal is to hit both locations
on both ships in 15 missiles or less.
(note: selecting a previous hit again will result in a miss!)
